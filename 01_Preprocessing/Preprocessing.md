# WGS Preprocessing: From FASTQ to BAM files

The analysis-ready BAM files used in this study were created during our initial American Redstart migratory connectivity study that is already [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17137). Details can be found in the corresponding repository: [amre-mc respository](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-mc/blob/main/01_Bioinformatics/README.md)

These BAM files are then used as input in the next section, [Population genetic analyses](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/02_PopulationGenetics/Popgen.md).
