# WGS Preprocessing: From FASTQ to BAM files

Analysis-ready BAM files were produced from FASTQ files following methods I have outlined elsewhere for another project: [bcrf-climate respository](https://github.com/mgdesaix/bcrf-climate/blob/main/01_Preprocessing/Preprocessing.md)

These analysis-ready BAM files are then used as input in the next section, [Population genetic analyses](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/02_PopulationGenetics/Popgen.md).
