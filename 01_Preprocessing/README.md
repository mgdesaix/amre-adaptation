# WGS Preprocessing: From FASTQ to BAM files

The analysis-ready BAM files used in this study were created during our initial American Redstart migratory connectivity study that is already published ([DeSaix et al. 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17137)). Analysis details and example code can be found in the corresponding repository: [amre-mc respository](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-mc/blob/main/01_Bioinformatics/)

These BAM files are then used as input in the next section, [Population genetic analyses](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/02_PopulationGenetics/).
