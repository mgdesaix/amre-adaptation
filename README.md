# Conservation genomics analysis of low-coverage whole genome sequencing data from the American Redstart

Bioinformatics and analysis scripts for research on American Redstart (*Setophaga ruticilla*) adaptation across the annual cycle using low-coverage whole genome sequence data. These data consist of 182 individuals from 16 sampling locations across their breeding range and 147 individuals from 15 sampling locations across the overwintering range. I provide these scripts for data reproducibility of our American Redstart research, but I also provide readers with some tutorial style *tips and tricks* I've learned for efficiently working with low-coverage data in general. See the subsections below for specific details:

1.  [Data preprocessing](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/01_Preprocessing/Preprocessing.md): Producing analysis-ready BAM files from FASTQ files

2.  [Population genetics](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/02_PopulationGenetics/Popgen.md): Principal components analysis, relatedness, linkage disequilibrium, ancestry values, and more! Lots of ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data)
