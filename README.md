# Local adaptation across the annual cycle: American Redstart

<img src="./img/trini-fieldwork.jpg" alt="Trinidad-fieldwork" width="600"/>

Bioinformatics and analysis scripts for research on local adaptation in American Redstart (*Setophaga ruticilla*) populations across the annual cycle using low-coverage whole genome sequence data. This research builds upon our previous work investigating migratory connectivity in the American Redstart:
[Low-coverage whole genome sequencing for highly accurate population assignment: Mapping migratory connectivity in the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17137)

See the subsections below for specific details of the analyses:

## 1) Bioinformatics

1.  [Data preprocessing](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/01_Preprocessing/): Producing analysis-ready BAM files from FASTQ files

## 2) Population structure and migratory connectivity

2.  [Population genetics](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/02_PopulationGenetics/): Principal components analysis, relatedness, linkage disequilibrium, ancestry values, and more! Lots of ANGSD (Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data)

3.  [Population assignment](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/blob/main/03_PopulationAssignment/): SNP screening, leave-one-out validation, and assignment probabilities with low-coverage data

## 3) Local adaptation
